## Description
A site in which a user can enter a word to be translated into Pig Latin. It uses JavaScript logic to identify what the first letter of the word is (vowel or consonant). Based off that, the program will either add an "ay" to the word's beginning, or move on to the next letter. It will repeat this until it finds a vowel, at which point it will split the word putting the letters before the vowel at the end followed by an "ay".
